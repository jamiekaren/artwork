# My Artwork

This repo is to create a central location to display my personal artwork. Currently, most of my art is in either pencil or watercolor.


# Some Background On My Artwork

I'm a self-taught artist, learning from experience, books, online tutorials, and practice. I have always loved drawing since I was young. 
As I got older, I've had less time to draw and create than when I was younger, so a lot of my current pieces are years old at this point.
